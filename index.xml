      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Brandon. I write code for a living. Sometimes for companies, sometimes for myself.
This is a personal blog which I use to document my learning journey and share my work with the world.
You can learn more about my professional experience on my LinkedIn profile.
If anyone needs a frontend/backend web developer, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for opportunities to collaborate, and work on new projects. Please do not hesitate to email me at byu1628[at]proton[dot]me.</description>

      <description>During COVID-19, my university debuted an attendance tracking called Hi-Hive Community. A lecturer would present a QR code, and the students will scan it to take attendance.
Like the previous paper based attendance solution, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually stop students from skipping class. Nontheless, that&amp;rsquo;s not the issue we&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing today.
After using the application for a few years, I noticed that the original application is too bloated with unnecessary features, it&amp;rsquo;s too slow, and important items are buried in unending levels of menus.</description>
