So how would someone take back control of their phone? It’s a common question for people dipping their feet into the privacy world.\nIn this article, we shall inspect methods of privatizing and limiting data collection as much as possible from your mobile devices.\nThe flavor of Android that I would recommend is LineageOS because it supports the most devices among all the custom roms available and does not pre-package Google Play Services or any of their apps by default.\nBefore we start It is expected that people who follow this guide to:\n Be technically literate. Have experience with the commandline. Have experience with unlocking their phone, installing custom roms and recoveries. Have a device that is unlockable and supported by LineageOS.  Unlocking your device. Every device has a different unlocking method, and thus it is too broad to be covered in this article. Fortunately, LineageOS provides a step by step guide to unlocking devices that is supported by them.\nGo to LineageOS’s website  your_device  Installation instructions, and you shall see the guide.\nSetting up the recovery. In general, you can just follow the instructions in the guide to install it. Here, we’re gonna explain some good to know stuff about recoveries.\nFor one, there a few different recovery software, namely\nTeam Win Recovery Project (TWRP) TWRP is probably the most famous open source recoveries used in the custom rom world. It is advantageous if you want to experiment and install many different type of custom roms, it is also easier to use in the sense that you can install stuff without using a computer.\nHowever, it does not do signature verification of files it flashes, and automatic upgrades of OTAs can be quite wonky.\nLineageOS’s own custom recovery. This is a minimalist recovery, who’s job is to install LineageOS.\nThe advantage of this is that\n It does signature verification of packages it installs which although the recovery itself isn’t verified, it improves security a bit as an attacker now have to compromise the recovery instead of the LineageOS image file. Allow for automatic upgrades of LineageOS OTA so you don’t have to download and install the image manually during updates.  The disadvantage however is that\n It’s not as flexible and easy to use as recoveries such as TWRP. You have to have a computer and flash images using adb and fastboot commandline tools as oppose to just downloading the file one your device and install it through your recovery like you can when using TWRP.  It’s images are usually listed alongside the ROM images on the LineageOS download page.\nVariants of LineageOS’s custom recovery Forks of LineageOS also often include the custom recovery that verifies their own images signed by them. Projects such as Lineage4Microg does this, so it’s important that you also remember to change the custom recovery when you change your custom rom.\nSetting up LineageOS for use.
