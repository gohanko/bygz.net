      <description>During COVID-19, my university debuted an attendance tracking called Hi-Hive Community. A lecturer would present a QR code, and the students will scan it to take attendance.
Like the previous paper based attendance solution, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually stop students from skipping class. Nontheless, that&amp;rsquo;s not the issue we&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing today.
After using the application for a few years, I noticed that the original application is too bloated with unnecessary features, it&amp;rsquo;s too slow, and important items are buried in unending levels of menus.</description>
