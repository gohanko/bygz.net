      <description>During COVID-19, my university debuted an attendance tracking called Hi-Hive. A lecturer would present a QR code, and the students will scan it to take attendance.
Like the previous paper based attendance solution, students just asked their friends to send them the QR code to skip class. Nontheless, that&amp;rsquo;s not the issue we&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing today.
After using the application for a few years, I noticed that the original application is too bloated with unnecessary features, it&amp;rsquo;s too slow, and important items are buried in unending levels of menus.</description>
