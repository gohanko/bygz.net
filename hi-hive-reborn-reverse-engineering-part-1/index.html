A lecturer would present a QR code, and the students will scan it to take attendance.\nAfter using the application for a few years, I noticed that it is too bloated with unnecessary features, it’s not very responsive, and important items are buried in unending levels of menus.\nThus, I have the idea of rebuilding the application using a Jetpack Compose, and more modern UI frameworks.\nTo do so, I first needed to figure how the API works.\nPreliminary Analysis Through regular usage, I suspected that it uses some kind of web/mobile hybrid framework.\nSome symptoms I’ve noticed are:\nSlow and slightly off user interface - There will be slight delays when tapping on elements, animation is slow, and low frame rates at times. Lack of uniformity in the components - A lot of the components seems custom made. There are a mix of native elements with custom ones. Existence of web-view like pages - Some of the functions are loaded through webview. All in all it feels like using a website. My gut feelings tell me that it’s a web/mobile hybrid framework. Most likely using React Native.\nDissecting the Application The only method to really confirm this is by cracking it open and have a look at the internals. Here, we will be using version 2.3.1 of the applicaiton downloaded from ApkPure.\nUnpacking the .apk I unpacked the .apk using jadx and immediately there are telltale signs of React Native.\nFor example, this image below shows configuration for a react native push notification library.\nWhich upon further investigation, it appears that this library that was used: https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification, which is a React Native library.\nChecking for presence of index.android.bundle Furthermore, there is also presence of index.android.bundle as seen below.\nThe index.android.bundle contains compiled and bundled JavaScript code the application.\nDisassembling Hermes Bytecode I tried to open the bundle using a text editor but it showed an error.\nAfter a google search, I found out that Hermes VM is the default compilation target for more recent versions of React Native. Which is confirmed by the file command.\nFortunately, P1 Security released a tool to disassemble, and decompile Hermes bytecodes.\nUsing the tool, hermes-dec, I disassembled the Hermes Bytecode into somewhat readable bytecode.\nHowever this is still super unreadable, due to it being converted from javascript -\u003e obfuscated javascript -\u003e hermes bytecode -\u003e decompiled WASM -\u003e disassembled JS. Which meant that it’s a “readable” version of the WASM code.\nIdeally, we want it to be javascript -\u003e obfuscated javascript, which should mean it’s more readable.\nBack to the beginning and cracking an older version. The hermes-dec GitHub README file mentioned that React Native only started targetting Hermes VM by default after React Native 0.70.\nI thought, what if the targetting of Hermes VM isn’t actually on purpose by the developer? So I grabbed version 1.0.2 of the application and cracked it open.\nAs I thought, the index.android.bundle file is only obfuscated Javascript, not Hermes Bytecode!\nThis is a more readable version of the index.android.bundle file compared to the one of version 2.3.1 but not by much. But it’s still better than nothing.\nWhat this means is that we now have a base to reverse engineer the API used by the application.\nReversing the API Mapping the Endpoints Roadblock to putting together a 3rd party library Other Methods Conclusion ","wordCount":"567","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-09-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-09-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yii Kuo Chong"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gohanko.github.io/codeowl.space/hi-hive-reborn-reverse-engineering-part-1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"codeowl.space","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gohanko.github.io/codeowl.space/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gohanko.github.io/codeowl.space/ accesskey=h title="codeowl.space (Alt + H)">codeowl.space</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gohanko.github.io/codeowl.space/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gohanko.github.io/codeowl.space/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gohanko.github.io/codeowl.space/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Hi-Hive Reborn: Reverse Engineering the Application (Part 1)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-09-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 9, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Yii Kuo Chong</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#preliminary-analysis aria-label="Preliminary Analysis">Preliminary Analysis</a></li><li><a href=#dissecting-the-application aria-label="Dissecting the Application">Dissecting the Application</a><ul><li><a href=#unpacking-the-apk aria-label="Unpacking the .apk">Unpacking the .apk</a></li><li><a href=#checking-for-presence-of-indexandroidbundle aria-label="Checking for presence of index.android.bundle">Checking for presence of index.android.bundle</a></li><li><a href=#disassembling-hermes-bytecode aria-label="Disassembling Hermes Bytecode">Disassembling Hermes Bytecode</a></li><li><a href=#back-to-the-beginning-and-cracking-an-older-version aria-label="Back to the beginning and cracking an older version.">Back to the beginning and cracking an older version.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#reversing-the-api aria-label="Reversing the API">Reversing the API</a><ul><li><a href=#mapping-the-endpoints aria-label="Mapping the Endpoints">Mapping the Endpoints</a></li><li><a href=#roadblock-to-putting-together-a-3rd-party-library aria-label="Roadblock to putting together a 3rd party library">Roadblock to putting together a 3rd party library</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#other-methods aria-label="Other Methods">Other Methods</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>During COVID-19, my university debuted an attendance tracking called Hi-Hive Community.
