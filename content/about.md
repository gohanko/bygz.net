My name is Yii Kuo Chong, people call me Brandon. I write code for a living. Sometimes at full time positions, sometimes I take on projects. A fortune teller in Taipei once told me that it's important to take the first steps than to be afraid of failure. That's what I'm doing.

This website is a personal blog which I use to document my learning journey and share my work with the world.

You can learn more about my professional experience on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gohanko/) profile.

If anyone needs a frontend/backend web developer, I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate, and work on new projects. Please do not hesitate to email me at `byu1628[at]proton[dot]me`.
